abstract = {Scene labeling consists of labeling each pixel in an image with the category of the object it belongs to. We propose a method that uses a multiscale convolutional network trained from raw pixels to extract dense feature vectors that encode regions of multiple sizes centered on each pixel. The method alleviates the need for engineered features, and produces a powerful representation that captures texture, shape, and contextual information. We report results using multiple postprocessing methods to produce the final labeling. Among those, we propose a technique to automatically retrieve, from a pool of segmentation components, an optimal set of components that best explain the scene; these components are arbitrary, for example, they can be taken from a segmentation tree or from any family of oversegmentations. The system yields record accuracies on the SIFT Flow dataset (33 classes) and the Barcelona dataset (170 classes) and near-record accuracy on Stanford background dataset (eight classes), while being an order of magnitude faster than competing approaches, producing a 320{\&}{\#}x00D7;240 image labeling in less than a second, including feature extraction.},

abstract = {FlowNet2 [14], the state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) for optical flow estimation, requires over 160M parameters to achieve accurate flow estimation. In this paper we present an alternative network that attains performance on par with FlowNet2 on the challenging Sin-tel final pass and KITTI benchmarks, while being 30 times smaller in the model size and 1.36 times faster in the running speed. This is made possible by drilling down to architectural details that might have been missed in the current frameworks: (1) We present a more effective flow inference approach at each pyramid level through a lightweight cascaded network. It not only improves flow estimation accuracy through early correction, but also permits seamless incorporation of descriptor matching in our network. (2) We present a novel flow regularization layer to ameliorate the issue of outliers and vague flow boundaries by using a feature-driven local convolution. (3) Our network owns an effective structure for pyramidal feature extraction and embraces feature warping rather than image warping as practiced in FlowNet2. Our code and trained models are available at github.com/twhui/LiteFlowNet.},

abstract = {State-of-the-art models for semantic segmentation are based on adaptations of convolutional networks that had originally been designed for image classification. However, dense prediction and image classification are structurally different. In this work, we develop a new convolutional network module that is specifically designed for dense prediction. The presented module uses dilated convolutions to systematically aggregate multi-scale contextual information without losing resolution. The architecture is based on the fact that dilated convolutions support exponential expansion of the receptive field without loss of resolution or coverage. We show that the presented context module increases the accuracy of state-of-the-art semantic segmentation systems. In addition, we examine the adaptation of image classification networks to dense prediction and show that simplifying the adapted network can increase accuracy.},

abstract = {Extending state-of-the-art object detectors from image to video is challenging. The accuracy of detection suffers from degenerated object appearances in videos, e.g., motion blur, video defocus, rare poses, etc. Existing work attempts to exploit temporal information on box level, but such methods are not trained end-to-end. We present flow-guided feature aggregation, an accurate and end-to-end learning framework for video object detection. It leverages temporal coherence on feature level instead. It improves the per-frame features by aggregation of nearby features along the motion paths, and thus improves the video recognition accuracy. Our method significantly improves upon strong single-frame baselines in ImageNet VID, especially for more challenging fast moving objects. Our framework is principled, and on par with the best engineered systems winning the ImageNet VID challenges 2016, without additional bells-and-whistles. The code would be released.},

The user only requests a change in a semantic binary attribute and the input image (a) is automatically transformed into, e.g., an image with a "big nose" (b) or "narrowed eyes" (c). The identity and high resolution detail of the original input is preserved. Image courtesy of flickr user Kaue Lima. Abstract Deep neural networks have recently been used to edit images with great success. However, they are often limited by only being able to work at a restricted range of resolutions. They are also so flexible that semantic face edits can often result in an unwanted loss of identity. This work proposes a model that learns how to perform semantic image edits through the application of smooth warp fields. This warp field can be efficiently predicted at a reasonably low resolution and then resampled and applied at arbitrary resolutions. Previous approaches that attempted to use warping for semantic edits required paired data, that is example images of the same object with different semantic characteristics. In contrast, we employ recent advances in Generative Adversarial Networks that allow our model to be effectively trained with unpaired data. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method for editing face images at very high resolutions (4k images) with an efficient single forward pass of a deep network at a lower resolution. We illustrate how the extent of our edits can be trivially reduced or exaggerated by scaling the predicted warp field, and we also show that our edits are substantially better at maintaining the subject's identity.},

abstract = {We present a transformation-grounded image generation network for novel 3D view synthesis from a single image. Our approach first explicitly infers the parts of the geometry visible both in the input and novel views and then casts the remaining synthesis problem as image completion. Specifically, we both predict a flow to move the pixels from the input to the novel view along with a novel visibility map that helps deal with occulsion/disocculsion. Next, conditioned on those intermediate results, we hallucinate (infer) parts of the object invisible in the input image. In addition to the new network structure, training with a combination of adversarial and perceptual loss results in a reduction in common artifacts of novel view synthesis such as distortions and holes, while successfully generating high frequency details and preserving visual aspects of the input image. We evaluate our approach on a wide range of synthetic and real examples. Both qualitative and quantitative results show our method achieves significantly better results compared to existing methods.},

In this survey paper, we review the state-of-the-art registration algorithms and discuss their common mathematical foundation. Starting from simple deterministic methods, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Singular Value Decomposition SVD), more recently introduced approaches such as Iterative Closest Point (ICP) and its variants, are analyzed and compared.

abstract = {Semantic understanding of urban street scenes through visual perception has been widely studied due to many pos-sible practical applications. Key challenges arise from the high visual complexity of such scenes. In this paper, we present ongoing work on a new large-scale dataset for (1) assessing the performance of vision algorithms for differ-ent tasks of semantic urban scene understanding, including scene labeling, instance-level scene labeling, and object de-tection; (2) supporting research that aims to exploit large volumes of (weakly) annotated data, e.g. for training deep neural networks. We aim to provide a large and diverse set of stereo video sequences recorded in street scenes from 50 different cities, with high quality pixel-level annotations of 5000 frames in addition to a larger set of weakly annotated frames. The dataset is thus an order of magnitude larger than similar previous attempts. Several aspects are still up for discussion, and timely feedback from the community would be greatly appreciated. Details on annotated classes and examples will be avail-able at www.cityscapes-dataset.net. Moreover, we will use this website to collect remarks and suggestions.},

abstract = {This work addresses multi-class segmentation of indoor scenes with RGB-D inputs. While this area of research has gained much attention recently, most works still rely on hand-crafted features. In contrast, we apply a multiscale convolutional network to learn features directly from the images and the depth information. Using a frame by frame labeling, we obtain nearly state-of-the-art performance on the NYU-v2 depth dataset with an accuracy of 64.5{\%}. We then show that the labeling can be further improved by exploiting the temporal consistency in the video sequence of the scene. To that goal, we present a method producing temporally consistent superpixels from a streaming video. Among the different methods producing superpixel segmentations of an image, the graph-based approach of Felzenszwalb and Huttenlocher is broadly employed. One of its interesting properties is that the regions are computed in a greedy manner in quasi-linear time by using a minimum spanning tree. In a framework exploiting minimum spanning trees all along, we propose an efficient video segmentation approach that computes temporally consistent pixels in a causal manner, filling the need for causal and real-time applications. We illustrate the labeling of indoor scenes in video sequences that could be processed in real-time using appropriate hardware such as an FPGA.},

We apply the trained network to each proposal in an input image, and construct the final semantic segmentation map by combining the results from all proposals in a simple manner. The proposed algorithm mitigates the limitations of the existing methods based on fully convolutional networks by integrating deep deconvolution network and proposal-wise prediction; our segmentation method typically identifies detailed structures and handles objects in multiple scales naturally. Our network demonstrates outstanding performance in PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset, and we achieve the best accuracy (72.5{\%}) among the methods trained with no external data through ensemble with the fully convolutional network.},

abstract = {Object detection in videos has drawn increasing attention recently with the introduction of the large-scale ImageNet VID dataset. Different from object detection in static images, temporal information in videos provides vital information for object detection. To fully utilize temporal information, state-of-the-art methods are therefore based on spatiotemporal tubelets, which are essentially sequences of associated bounding boxes across time. However, the existing methods have major limitations in generating tubelets in terms of quality and efficiency. Motion-based methods are able to obtain dense tubelets, but the lengths are generally only several frames, which is not optimal to incorporate long-term temporal information. Appearance-based methods, usually involving generic object tracking, could generate long tubelets, but are usually computational expensive. In this work, we propose a framework for object detection in videos, which consists of a novel tubelet proposal network to efficiently generate spatiotemporal proposals, and a Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) network that incorporates temporal information from tubelet proposals for achieving high object detection accuracy in videos. The experiments on the large-scale ImageNet VID dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for object detection in videos.},

abstract = {3D shape models are becoming widely available and easier to capture, making available 3D information crucial for progress in object classification. Current state-of-the-art methods rely on CNNs to address this problem. Recently, we witness two types of CNNs being developed: CNNs based upon volumetric representations versus CNNs based upon multi-view representations. Empirical results from these two types of CNNs exhibit a large gap, indicating that existing volumetric CNN architectures and approaches are unable to fully exploit the power of 3D representations. In this paper, we aim to improve both volumetric CNNs and multi-view CNNs according to extensive analysis of existing approaches. To this end, we introduce two distinct network architectures of volumetric CNNs. In addition, we examine multi-view CNNs, where we introduce multi-resolution filtering in 3D. Overall, we are able to outperform current state-of-the-art methods for both volumetric CNNs and multi-view CNNs. We provide extensive experiments designed to evaluate underlying design choices, thus providing a better understanding of the space of methods available for object classification on 3D data.},

abstract = {Passive navigation of mobile robots is one of the chal-lenging goals of machine vision. This note demonstrates the use of optical flow, which encodes the visual infor-mation in a sequence of time varying images [1], for the recovery of motion and the understanding of the three dimensional structure of the viewed scene. By using a modified version of an algorithm, which has recently been proposed to compute optical flow, it is possible to obtain dense and accurate estimates of the true ID motion field. Then these estimates are used to recover the angular ve-locity of the viewed rigid objects. Finally it is shown that, when the camera translation is known, a coarse depth map of the scene can be extracted from the optical flow of real time varying images. The navigation of a robot in any environment requires the knowledge of the motion of the robot relative to the environment, the three dimensional structure of the scene and the motion parameters of the object moving in the scene. These informations can be obtained by us-ing active sensors and/or by passive vision, provided by cameras mounted on the robot. In this note it is shown how passive vision can be used to recover depth when the camera on the robot is trans-lating and angular velocity when the camera looks at rotating objects. The proposed technique first computes the optical from a sequence of time varying images by using a modification of the algorithm recently proposed [2,3]. The angular velocity can be obtained by exploit-ing mathematical properties of the 2D motion field [5]. Depth is obtained from the computed optical flow, using an equation already proposed by many authors (Horn 1987 , Tommasi personal communication).},

abstract = {Generation of 3D data by deep neural networks has been attracting increasing attention in the research community. The majority of extant works resort to regular representations such as volumetric grids or collections of images; however, these representations obscure the natural invariance of 3D shapes under geometric transformations, and also suffer from a number of other issues. In this paper we address the problem of 3D reconstruction from a single image, generating a straight-forward form of output - point cloud coordinates. Along with this problem arises a unique and interesting issue, that the groundtruth shape for an input image may be ambiguous. Driven by this unorthodox output form and the inherent ambiguity in groundtruth, we design architecture, loss function and learning paradigm that are novel and effective. Our final solution is a conditional shape sampler, capable of predicting multiple plausible 3D point clouds from an input image. In experiments not only can our system outperform state-of-the-art methods on single image based 3d reconstruction benchmarks; but it also shows strong performance for 3D shape completion and promising ability in making multiple plausible predictions.},

In contrast to previous region-based detectors such as Fast/Faster R-CNN that apply a costly per-region subnetwork hundreds of times, our region-based detector is fully convolutional with almost all computation shared on the entire image. To achieve this goal, we propose position-sensitive score maps to address a dilemma between translation-invariance in image classification and translation-variance in object detection. Our method can thus naturally adopt fully convolutional image classifier backbones, such as the latest Residual Networks (ResNets), for object detection. We show competitive results on the PASCAL VOC datasets (e.g., 83.6{\%} mAP on the 2007 set) with the 101-layer ResNet. Meanwhile, our result is achieved at a test-time speed of 170ms per image, 2.5-20x faster than the Faster R-CNN counterpart.

Our recording platform is equipped with four high resolution video cameras, a Velodyne laser scanner and a state-of-the-art localization system. Our benchmarks comprise 389 stereo and optical flow image pairs, stereo visual odometry sequences of 39.2 km length, and more than 200k 3D object annotations captured in cluttered scenarios (up to 15 cars and 30 pedestrians are visible per image). Results from state-of-the-art algorithms reveal that methods ranking high on established datasets such as Middlebury perform below average when being moved outside the laboratory to the real world. Our goal is to reduce this bias by providing challenging benchmarks with novel difficulties to the computer vision community. Our benchmarks are available online at: www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti.},

Given this, we devise an optical flow algorithm specifically for human motion and show that it is superior to generic flow methods. Designing a method by hand is impractical, so we develop a new training database of image sequences with ground truth optical flow. For this we use a 3D model of the human body and motion capture data to synthesize realistic flow fields. We then train a convolutional neural network to estimate human flow fields from pairs of images. Since many applications in human motion analysis depend on speed, and we anticipate mobile applications, we base our method on SpyNet with several modifications. We demonstrate that our trained network is more accurate than a wide range of top methods on held-out test data and that it generalizes well to real image sequences. When combined with a person detector/tracker, the approach provides a full solution to the problem of 2D human flow estimation. Both the code and the dataset are available for research.},

abstract = {We introduce an approach that leverages surface normal predictions, along with appearance cues, to retrieve 3D models for objects depicted in 2D still images from a large CAD object library. Critical to the success of our approach is the ability to recover accurate surface normals for objects in the depicted scene. We introduce a skip-network model built on the pre-trained Oxford VGG convolutional neural network (CNN) for surface normal prediction. Our model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the NYUv2 RGB-D dataset for surface normal prediction, and recovers fine object detail compared to previous methods. Furthermore, we develop a two-stream network over the input image and predicted surface normals that jointly learns pose and style for CAD model retrieval. When using the predicted surface normals, our two-stream network matches prior work using surface normals computed from RGB-D images on the task of pose prediction, and achieves state of the art when using RGB-D input. Finally, our two-stream network allows us to retrieve CAD models that better match the style and pose of a depicted object compared with baseline approaches.},

abstract = {The finding that very large networks can be trained efficiently and reliably has led to a paradigm shift in computer vision from engineered solutions to learning formulations. As a result, the research challenge shifts from devising algorithms to creating suitable and abundant training data for supervised learning. How to efficiently create such training data? The dominant data acquisition method in visual recognition is based on web data and manual annotation. Yet, for many computer vision problems, such as stereo or optical flow estimation, this approach is not feasible because humans cannot manually enter a pixel-accurate flow field. In this paper, we promote the use of synthetically generated data for the purpose of training deep networks on such tasks. We suggest multiple ways to generate such data and evaluate the influence of dataset properties on the performance and generalization properties of the resulting networks. We also demonstrate the benefit of learning schedules that use different types of data at selected stages of the training process.},

How-ever, from a biological standpoint, neuron activity may as well involve inherently nonlinear and competitive operations. Mathematical morphol-ogy and minimax algebra provide the necessary background in the study of neural networks made up from these kinds of nonlinear units. This paper deals with such a model, called the morphological perceptron. We study some of its geometrical properties and introduce a training algo-rithm for binary classification. We point out the relationship between morphological classifiers and the recent field of tropical geometry, which enables us to obtain a precise bound on the number of linear regions of the maxout unit, a popular choice for deep neural networks introduced recently.

However, the state of the art with regard to the quality of the flow has still been defined by traditional methods. Particularly on small displacements and real-world data, FlowNet cannot compete with variational methods. In this paper, we advance the concept of end-to-end learning of optical flow and make it work really well. The large improvements in quality and speed are caused by three major contributions: first, we focus on the training data and show that the schedule of presenting data during training is very important. Second, we develop a stacked architecture that includes warping of the second image with intermediate optical flow. Third, we elaborate on small displacements by introducing a sub-network specializing on small motions. FlowNet 2.0 is only marginally slower than the original FlowNet but decreases the estimation error by more than 50{\%}. It performs on par with state-of-the-art methods, while running at interactive frame rates. Moreover, we present faster variants that allow optical flow computation at up to 140fps with accuracy matching the original FlowNet.},

We present a model to create and render trees. Our emphasis is on the overall geometrical structure of the tree and not a strict adherence to botanical principles. Since the model must be utilized by general users, it does not require any knowledge beyond the principles of basic geometry.

abstract = {Nowadays, detecting objects in 3D scenes like point clouds has become an emerging challenge with various applications. However, it retains as an open problem due to the deficiency of labeling 3D training data. To deploy an accurate detection algorithm typically resorts to investigating both RGB and depth modalities, which have distinct statistics while correlated with each other. Previous research mainly focus on detecting objects using only one modality, which ignores exploiting the cross-modality cues. In this work, we propose a cross-modality deep learning framework based on deep Boltzmann Machines for 3D Scenes object detection. In particular, we demonstrate that by learning cross-modality feature from RGBD data, it is possible to capture their joint information to reinforce detector trainings in individual modalities. In particular, we slide a 3D detection window in the 3D point cloud to match the exemplar shape, which the lack of training data in 3D domain is conquered via (1) We collect 3D CAD models and 2D positive samples from Internet. (2) adopt pretrained R-CNNs [2] to extract raw feature from both RGB and Depth domains. Experiments on RMRC dataset demonstrate that the bimodal based deep feature learning framework helps 3D scene object detection.},

As an example we use the tasks of depth estimation and semantic segmentation given a single RGB image. The main focus of this work is to analyze the cross-modality influence between depth and semantic prediction maps on their joint refinement. While most previous works solely focus on measuring improvements in accuracy, we propose a way to quantify the cross-modality influence. We show that there is a relationship between final accuracy and cross-modality influence, although not a simple linear one. Hence a larger cross-modality influence does not necessarily translate into an improved accuracy. We find that a beneficial balance between the cross-modality influences can be achieved by network architecture and conjecture that this relationship can be utilized to understand different network design choices. Towards this end we propose a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture that fuses the state of the state-of-the-art results for depth estimation and semantic labeling. By balancing the cross-modality influences between depth and semantic prediction, we achieve improved results for both tasks using the NYU-Depth v2 benchmark.},

This work brings together methods from DCNNs and probabilistic graphical models for addressing the task of pixel-level classification (also called "semantic image segmentation"). We show that responses at the final layer of DCNNs are not sufficiently localized for accurate object segmentation. This is due to the very invariance properties that make DCNNs good for high level tasks. We overcome this poor localization property of deep networks by combining the responses at the final DCNN layer with a fully connected Conditional Random Field (CRF). Qualitatively, our "DeepLab" system is able to localize segment boundaries at a level of accuracy which is beyond previous methods. Quantitatively, our method sets the new state-of-art at the PASCAL VOC-2012 semantic image segmentation task, reaching 71.6{\%} IOU accuracy in the test set. We show how these results can be obtained efficiently: Careful network re-purposing and a novel application of the 'hole' algorithm from the wavelet community allow dense computation of neural net responses at 8 frames per second on a modern GPU.},

We apply the al-gorithm to image segmentation using two different kinds of local neighborhoods in constructing the graph, and illustrate the results with both real and synthetic images. The algorithm runs in time nearly linear in the number of graph edges and is also fast in practice.

abstract = {The quantitative evaluation of optical flow algorithms by Barron et al. (1994) led to significant advances in performance. The challenges for optical flow algorithms today go beyond the datasets and evaluation methods proposed in that paper. Instead, they center on problems associated with complex natural scenes, including nonrigid motion, real sensor noise, and motion discontinuities. We propose a new set of benchmarks and evaluation methods for the next generation of optical flow algorithms. To that end, we contribute four types of data to test different aspects of optical flow algorithms: (1) sequences with nonrigid motion where the ground-truth flow is determined by tracking hidden fluorescent texture, (2) realistic synthetic sequences, (3) high frame-rate video used to study interpolation error, and (4) modified stereo sequences of static scenes. In addition to the average angular error used by Barron et al., we compute the absolute flow endpoint error, measures for frame interpolation error, improved statistics, and results at motion discontinuities and in textureless regions. In October 2007, we published the performance of several well-known methods on a preliminary version of our data to establish the current state of the art. We also made the data freely available on the web at http://vision.middlebury.edu/flow/ . Subsequently a number of researchers have uploaded their results to our website and published papers using the data. A significant improvement in performance has already been achieved. In this paper we analyze the results obtained to date and draw a large number of conclusions from them.},

When synthetic pre-training includes a depth channel (something ImageNet cannot na-tively provide) the performance is greater still.

We build on the observation that the scene is typically composed of a static background, as well as a relatively small number of traffic participants which move rigidly in 3D. We propose to estimate the traffic participants using instance-level segmentation. For each traffic participant, we use the epipolar constraints that govern each independent motion for faster and more accurate estimation. Our second contribution is a new convolutional net that learns to perform flow matching, and is able to estimate the uncertainty of its matches. This is a core element of our flow estimation pipeline.

abstract = {The use of object proposals is an effective recent approach for increasing the computational efficiency of object detection. We propose a novel method for generating object bounding box proposals using edges. Edges provide a sparse yet informative representation of an image. Our main observation is that the number of contours that are wholly contained in a bounding box is indicative of the likelihood of the box containing an object. We propose a simple box objectness score that measures the number of edges that exist in the box minus those that are members of contours that overlap the box's boundary. Using efficient data structures, millions of candidate boxes can be evaluated in a fraction of a second, returning a ranked set of a few thousand top-scoring proposals. Using standard metrics, we show results that are significantly more accurate than the current state-of-the-art while being faster to compute. In particular, given just 1000 proposals we achieve over 96{\%} object recall at overlap threshold of 0.5 and over 75{\%} recall at the more challenging overlap of 0.7. Our approach runs in 0.25 seconds and we additionally demonstrate a near real-time variant with only minor loss in accuracy.},

abstract = {We address the problem of inferring the pose of an RGB-D camera relative to a known 3D scene, given only a single acquired image. Our approach employs a regression forest that is capable of inferring an estimate of each pixel's correspondence to 3D points in the scene's world coordinate frame. The forest uses only simple depth and RGB pixel comparison features, and does not require the computation of feature descriptors. The forest is trained to be capable of predicting correspondences at any pixel, so no interest point detectors are required. The camera pose is inferred using a robust optimization scheme. This starts with an initial set of hypothesized camera poses, constructed by applying the forest at a small fraction of image pixels. Preemptive RANSAC then iterates sampling more pixels at which to evaluate the forest, counting inliers, and refining the hypothesized poses. We evaluate on several varied scenes captured with an RGB-D camera and observe that the proposed technique achieves highly accurate relocalization and substantially out-performs two state of the art baselines.},

abstract = {We present a novel and practical deep fully convolutional neural network architecture for semantic pixel-wise segmentation termed SegNet. This core trainable segmentation engine consists of an encoder network, a corresponding decoder network followed by a pixel-wise classification layer. The architecture of the encoder network is topologically identical to the 13 convolutional layers in the VGG16 network [1]. The role of the decoder network is to map the low resolution encoder feature maps to full input resolution feature maps for pixel-wise classification. The novelty of SegNet lies is in the manner in which the decoder upsamples its lower resolution input feature map(s). Specifically, the decoder uses pooling indices computed in the max-pooling step of the corresponding encoder to perform non-linear upsampling. This eliminates the need for learning to upsample. The upsampled maps are sparse and are then convolved with trainable filters to produce dense feature maps.We compare our proposed architecture with the fully convolutional network [2] architecture and its variants. This comparison reveals the memory versus accuracy trade-off involved in achieving good segmentation performance. The design of SegNet was primarily motivated by road scene understanding applications. Hence, it is efficient both in terms of memory and computational time during inference. It is also significantly smaller in the number of trainable parameters than competing architectures and can be trained end-to-end using stochastic gradient descent without complex training protocols.We also benchmark the performance of SegNet on Pascal VOC12 salient object segmentation and the recent SUN RGB-D indoor scene understanding challenge. These quantitative assessments show that SegNet provides competitive performance although it is significantly faster than other architectures.We also provide a Caffe implementation of SegNet and a web demo at http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/projects/segnet/.

abstract = {We present a novel approach for unsupervised learning of depth and ego-motion from monocular video. Unsupervised learning removes the need for separate supervisory signals (depth or ego-motion ground truth, or multi-view video). Prior work in unsupervised depth learning uses pixel-wise or gradient-based losses, which only consider pixels in small local neighborhoods. Our main contribution is to explicitly consider the inferred 3D geometry of the whole scene, and enforce consistency of the estimated 3D point clouds and ego-motion across consecutive frames. This is a challenging task and is solved by a novel (approximate) backpropagation algorithm for aligning 3D structures. We combine this novel 3D-based loss with 2D losses based on photometric quality of frame reconstructions using estimated depth and ego-motion from adjacent frames. We also incorporate validity masks to avoid penalizing areas in which no useful information exists. We test our algorithm on the KITTI dataset and on a video dataset captured on an uncalibrated mobile phone camera. Our proposed approach consistently improves depth estimates on both datasets, and outperforms the state-of-the-art for both depth and ego-motion. Because we only require a simple video, learning depth and ego-motion on large and varied datasets becomes possible. We demonstrate this by training on the low quality uncalibrated video dataset and evaluating on KITTI, ranking among top performing prior methods which are trained on KITTI itself.1},

abstract = {Pixel-level labelling tasks, such as semantic segmentation, play a central role in image understanding. Recent approaches have attempted to harness the capabilities of deep learning techniques for image recognition to tackle pixel-level labelling tasks. One central issue in this methodology is the limited capacity of deep learning techniques to delineate visual objects. To solve this problem, we introduce a new form of convolutional neural network that combines the strengths of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs)-based probabilistic graphical modelling. To this end, we formulate Conditional Random Fields as Recurrent Neural Networks. This network, called CRF-RNN, is then plugged in as a part of a CNN to obtain a deep network that has desirable properties of both CNNs and CRFs. Importantly, our system fully integrates CRF modelling with CNNs, making it possible to train the whole deep network end-to-end with the usual back-propagation algorithm, avoiding offline post-processing methods for object delineation. We apply the proposed method to the problem of semantic image segmentation, obtaining top results on the challenging Pascal VOC 2012 segmentation benchmark.},

abstract = {This contribution11Partial results have been presented in a preliminary version at the ECCV '94 [42]. investigates local differential techniques for estimating optical flow and its derivatives based on the brightness change constraint. By using the tensor calculus representation we build the Taylor expansion of the gray-value derivatives as well as of the optical flow in a spatiotemporal neighborhood. Such a formulation provides a unifying framework for all existing local differential approaches and allows to derive new systems of equations for the estimation of the optical flow and of its derivatives. We also tested various optical flow estimation approaches on real image sequences recorded by a calibrated camera which was fixed on the arm of a robot. By moving the arm of the robot along a precisely defined trajectory, we can determine the true displacement rate of scene surface elements projected into the image plane and compare it quantitatively with the results of different optical flow estimators. Since the optical flow estimators are based on gray-value derivatives of up to fourth-order, we were forced to develop modified Gaussian derivative filters to obtain acceptable estimates for the derivatives. Further, we show quantitatively that these filters contribute to a much more robust optical flow estimation. In addition, successive lines of TV-cameras have an offset in time due to the interlace technique. We demonstrate the adaptation of filter kernels for estimating higher-order spatiotemporal derivatives in interlaced image sequences.},

abstract = {A bottleneck of state-of-the-art machine learning methods, e.g. deep learning, for plant part image segmentation in agricultural robotics is the requirement of large manually annotated datasets. As a solution, large synthetic datasets including ground truth can be rendered that realistically reflect the empirical situation. However, a dissimilarity gap can remain between synthetic and empirical data by incomplete manual modelling. This paper contributes to closing this gap by optimising the realism of synthetic agricultural images using unsupervised cycle generative adversarial networks, enabling unpaired image-to-image translation from the synthetic to empirical domain and vice versa. For this purpose, the Capsicum annuum (sweet- or bell pepper) dataset was used, containing 10,500 synthetic and 50 empirical annotated images. Additionally, 225 unlabelled empirical images were used. We hypothesised that the similarity of the synthetic images with the empirical images increases qualitatively and quantitively when translated to the empirical domain and investigated the effect of the translation on the factors color, local texture and morphology. Results showed an increased mean class color distribution correlation with the empirical dataset from 0.62 prior and 0.90 post translation of the synthetic dataset. Qualitatively, synthetic images translate very well in local features such as color,illumination scattering and texture. However, global features like plant morphology appeared not to be translatable.},

abstract = {Recent studies have shown remarkable success in image-to-image translation for two domains. However, existing approaches have limited scalability and robustness in handling more than two domains, since different models should be built independently for every pair of image domains. To address this limitation, we propose StarGAN, a novel and scalable approach that can perform image-to-image translations for multiple domains using only a single model. Such a unified model architecture of StarGAN allows simultaneous training of multiple datasets with different domains within a single network. This leads to StarGAN's superior quality of translated images compared to existing models as well as the novel capability of flexibly translating an input image to any desired target domain. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a facial attribute transfer and a facial expression synthesis tasks.},

The core of our approach is a fully convolutional network, which is learned entirely from synthetic video sequences, and their ground-truth optical flow and motion segmentation. This encoder-decoder style architecture first learns a coarse representation of the optical flow field features, and then refines it iteratively to produce motion labels at the original high-resolution. We further improve this labeling with an objectness map and a conditional random field, to account for errors in optical flow, and also to focus on moving "things" rather than "stuff". The output label of each pixel denotes whether it has undergone independent motion, i.e., irrespective of camera motion. We demonstrate the benefits of this learning framework on the moving object segmentation task, where the goal is to segment all objects in motion. Our approach outperforms the top method on the recently released DAVIS benchmark dataset, comprising real-world sequences, by 5.6{\%}. We also evaluate on the Berkeley motion segmentation database, achieving state-of-the-art results.},

abstract = {PointNet has recently emerged as a popular representation for unstructured point cloud data, allowing application of deep learning to tasks such as object detection, segmentation and shape completion. However, recent works in literature have shown the sensitivity of the PointNet representation to pose misalignment. This paper presents a novel framework that uses PointNet encoding to align point clouds and perform registration for applications such as 3D reconstruction, tracking and pose estimation. We develop a framework that compares PointNet features of template and source point clouds to find the transformation that aligns them accurately. In doing so, we avoid computationally expensive correspondence finding steps, that are central to popular registration methods such as ICP and its variants. Depending on the prior information about the shape of the object formed by the point clouds, our framework can produce approaches that are shape specific or general to unseen shapes. Our framework produces approaches that are robust to noise and initial misalignment in data and work robustly with sparse as well as partial point clouds. We perform extensive simulation and real-world experiments to validate the efficacy of our approach and compare the performance with state-of-art approaches.

abstract = {A longstanding question in computer vision concerns the representation of 3D shapes for recognition: should 3D shapes be represented with descriptors operating on their native 3D formats, such as voxel grid or polygon mesh, or can they be effectively represented with view-based descriptors? We address this question in the context of learning to recognize 3D shapes from a collection of their rendered views on 2D images. We first present a standard CNN architecture trained to recognize the shapes' rendered views independently of each other, and show that a 3D shape can be recognized even from a single view at an accuracy far higher than using state-of-the-art 3D shape descriptors. Recognition rates further increase when multiple views of the shapes are provided. In addition, we present a novel CNN architecture that combines information from multiple views of a 3D shape into a single and compact shape descriptor offering even better recognition performance. The same architecture can be applied to accurately recognize human hand-drawn sketches of shapes. We conclude that a collection of 2D views can be highly informative for 3D shape recognition and is amenable to emerging CNN architectures and their derivatives.},

In this paper, we factorize the image generation process and propose Style and Structure Generative Adversarial Network (S{\^{}}2-GAN). Our S{\^{}}2-GAN has two components: the Structure-GAN generates a surface normal map; the Style-GAN takes the surface normal map as input and generates the 2D image.

We define and detail the space of fully convolutional networks, explain their application to spatially dense prediction tasks, and draw connections to prior models. We adapt contemporary classification networks (AlexNet, the VGG net, and GoogLeNet) into fully convolutional networks and transfer their learned representations by fine-tuning to the segmentation task. We then define a novel architecture that combines semantic information from a deep, coarse layer with appearance information from a shallow, fine layer to produce accurate and detailed segmentations.

abstract = {Optical flow cannot be computed locally, since only one independent measurement is available from the image sequence at a point, while the flow velocity has two components. A second constraint is needed. A method for finding the optical flow pattern is presented which assumes that the apparent velocity of the brightness pattern varies smoothly almost everywhere in the image. An iterative implementation is shown which successfully computes the optical flow for a number of synthetic image sequences. The algorithm is robust in that it can handle image sequences that are quantized rather coarsely in space and time. It is also insensitive to quantization of brightness levels and additive noise. Examples are included where the assumption of smoothness is violated at singular points or along lines in the image. {\textcopyright} 1981.},

abstract = {This paper presents algorithms for fast segmentation of 3D point clouds and subsequent classification of the obtained 3D segments. The method jointly determines the ground surface and segments individual ob-jects in 3D, including overhanging structures. When compared to six other terrain modelling techniques, this approach has minimal error between the sensed data and the representation; and is fast (processing a Velodyne scan in approximately 2 seconds). Applications include improved alignment of suc-cessive scans by enabling operations in sections (Velodyne scans are aligned 7{\%} sharper compared to an approach using raw points) and more informed decision-making (paths move around overhangs). The use of segmentation to aid classification through 3D features, such as the Spin Image or the Spher-ical Harmonic Descriptor, is discussed and experimentally compared. More-over, the segmentation facilitates a novel approach to 3D classification that bypasses feature extraction and directly compares 3D shapes via the ICP algorithm. This technique is shown to achieve accuracy on par with the best feature based classifier (92.1{\%}) while being significantly faster and allowing a clearer understanding of the classifier's behaviour.},

@article{Black1996,
abstract = {The modeling of spatial discontinuities for problems such as surface recovery, segmentation, image reconstruction, and optical flow has been intensely studied in computer vision. While ``line-process'' models of discontinuities have received a great deal of attention, there has been recent interest in the use of robust statistical techniques to account for discontinuities. This paper unifies the two approaches. To achieve this we generalize the notion of a ``line process'' to that of an analog ``outlier process'' and show how a problem formulated in terms of outlier processes can be viewed in terms of robust statistics. We also characterize a class of robust statistical problems for which an equivalent outlier-process formulation exists and give a straightforward method for converting a robust estimation problem into an outlier-process formulation. We show how prior assumptions about the spatial structure of outliers can be expressed as constraints on the recovered analog outlier processes and how traditional continuation methods can be extended to the explicit outlier-process formulation. These results indicate that the outlier-process approach provides a general framework which subsumes the traditional line-process approaches as well as a wide class of robust estimation problems. Examples in surface reconstruction, image segmentation, and optical flow are presented to illustrate the use of outlier processes and to show how the relationship between outlier processes and robust statistics can be exploited. An appendix provides a catalog of common robust error norms and their equivalent outlier-process formulations.},

abstract = {Normal estimation in point clouds is a crucial first step for numerous algorithms, from surface reconstruction and scene un-derstanding to rendering. A recurrent issue when estimating normals is to make appropriate decisions close to sharp features, not to smooth edges, or when the sampling density is not uniform, to prevent bias. Rather than resorting to manually-designed geometric priors, we propose to learn how to make these decisions, using ground-truth data made from synthetic scenes. For this, we project a discretized Hough space representing normal directions onto a structure amenable to deep learning. The resulting normal estimation method outperforms most of the time the state of the art regarding robustness to outliers, to noise and to point density variation, in the presence of sharp edges, while remaining fast, scaling up to millions of points.},

abstract = {This article presents a novel approach for 3D mesh labeling by using deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Many previous methods on 3D mesh labeling achieve impressive performances by using predefined ge-ometric features. However, the generalization abilities of such low-level features, which are heuristically designed to process specific meshes, are often insufficient to handle all types of meshes. To address this problem, we propose to learn a robust mesh representation that can adapt to various 3D meshes by using CNNs. In our approach, CNNs are first trained in a supervised manner by using a large pool of classical geometric features. In the training process, these low-level features are nonlinearly combined and hierarchically compressed to generate a compact and effective repre-sentation for each triangle on the mesh. Based on the trained CNNs and the mesh representations, a label vector is initialized for each triangle to indicate its probabilities of belonging to various object parts. Eventually, a graph-based mesh-labeling algorithm is adopted to optimize the labels of triangles by considering the label consistencies. Experimental results on several public benchmarks show that the proposed approach is robust for various 3D meshes, and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches as well as classic learning algorithms in recognizing mesh labels.},

Advances like SPPnet [7] and Fast R-CNN [5] have reduced the running time of these detection networks, exposing region pro-posal computation as a bottleneck. In this work, we introduce a Region Proposal Network (RPN) that shares full-image convolutional features with the detection network, thus enabling nearly cost-free region proposals. An RPN is a fully-convolutional network that simultaneously predicts object bounds and objectness scores at each position. RPNs are trained end-to-end to generate high-quality region proposals, which are used by Fast R-CNN for detection. With a simple alternating optimization, RPN and Fast R-CNN can be trained to share convolu-tional features.

abstract = {— Modern SLAM systems with a depth sensor are able to reliably reconstruct dense 3D geometric maps of indoor scenes. Representing these maps in terms of meaningful entities is a step towards building semantic maps for autonomous robots. One approach is to segment the 3D maps into semantic objects using Conditional Random Fields (CRF), which requires large 3D ground truth datasets to train the classification model. Additionally, the CRF inference is often computationally expensive. In this paper, we present an unsupervised geometricbased approach for the segmentation of 3D point clouds into objects and meaningful scene structures. We approximate an input point cloud by an adjacency graph over surface patches, whose edges are then classified as being either on or off. We devise an effective classifier which utilises both global planar surfaces and local surface convexities for edge classification. More importantly, we propose a novel global plane extraction algorithm for robustly discovering the underlying planes in the scene. Our algorithm is able to enforce the extracted planes to be mutually orthogonal or parallel which conforms usually with humanmade indoor environments. We reconstruct 654 3D indoor scenes from NYUv2 sequences to validate the efficiency and effectiveness of our segmentation method.},

Although the source code and the internal operation of commercial games are inaccessible, we show that associations between image patches can be reconstructed from the communication between the game and the graphics hardware. This enables rapid propagation of semantic labels within and across images synthesized by the game, with no access to the source code or the content. We validate the presented ap-proach by producing dense pixel-level semantic annotations for 25 thousand im-ages synthesized by a photorealistic open-world computer game. Experiments on semantic segmentation datasets show that using the acquired data to supplement real-world images significantly increases accuracy and that the acquired data en-ables reducing the amount of hand-labeled real-world data: models trained with game data and just 1 3 of the CamVid training set outperform models trained on the complete CamVid training set.},

Whereas the tremendous recent progress in object recognition tasks is due to the availability of large datasets like ImageNet and the rise of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for learning high-level features, performance at scene recognition has not attained the same level of success. This may be because current deep features trained from ImageNet are not competitive enough for such tasks. Here, we introduce a new scene-centric database called Places with over 7 million labeled pictures of scenes. We propose new methods to compare the density and diversity of image datasets and show that Places is as dense as other scene datasets and has more diversity. Using CNN, we learn deep features for scene recognition tasks, and establish new state-of-the-art results on several scene-centric datasets.

abstract = {We present an algorithm for fast global registration of partially over-lapping 3D surfaces. The algorithm operates on candidate matches that cover the surfaces. A single objective is optimized to align the surfaces and disable false matches. The objective is defined densely over the surfaces and the optimiza-tion achieves tight alignment with no initialization. No correspondence updates or closest-point queries are performed in the inner loop. An extension of the al-gorithm can perform joint global registration of many partially overlapping sur-faces. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the presented approach matches or exceeds the accuracy of state-of-the-art global registration pipelines, while be-ing at least an order of magnitude faster. Remarkably, the presented approach is also faster than local refinement algorithms such as ICP. It provides the accu-racy achieved by well-initialized local refinement algorithms, without requiring an initialization and at lower computational cost.},

abstract = {Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are the backbone of state-of-art semantic image segmentation systems. Recent work has shown that complementing CNNs with fully-connected conditional random fields (CRFs) can significantly enhance their object localization accuracy, yet dense CRF inference is computationally expensive. We propose replacing the fully-connected CRF with domain transform (DT), a modern edge-preserving filtering method in which the amount of smoothing is controlled by a reference edge map. Domain transform filtering is several times faster than dense CRF inference and we show that it yields comparable semantic segmentation results, accurately capturing object boundaries. Importantly, our formulation allows learning the reference edge map from intermediate CNN features instead of using the image gradient magnitude as in standard DT filtering. This produces task-specific edges in an end-to-end trainable system optimizing the target semantic segmentation quality.},

While much progress has been made in recent years, imaging conditions in natural outdoor environments are still very challenging for current reconstruction and recognition methods. In this paper, we propose a novel unified approach which reasons jointly about 3D scene flow as well as the pose, shape and motion of vehicles in the scene. Towards this goal, we incorporate a deformable CAD model into a slanted-plane conditional random field for scene flow estimation and enforce shape consistency between the rendered 3D models and the parameters of all superpixels in the image. The association of superpixels to objects is established by an index variable which implicitly enables model selection. We evaluate our approach on the challenging KITTI scene flow dataset in terms of object and scene flow estimation. Our results provide a prove of concept and demonstrate the usefulness of our method.},

The best-performing methods were complex ensemble systems that typically combined multiple low-level image features with high-level context. In this paper, we propose a simple and scalable detection algorithm that improves mean average precision (mAP) by more than 50{\%} relative to the previous best result on VOC 2012—achieving a mAP of 62.4{\%}. Our approach combines two ideas: (1) one can apply high-capacity convolutional networks (CNNs) to bottom-up region proposals in order to localize and segment objects and (2) when labeled training data are scarce, supervised pre-training for an auxiliary task, followed by domain-specific fine-tuning, boosts performance significantly. Since we combine region proposals with CNNs, we call the resulting model an R-CNN or Region-based Convolutional Network. Source code for the complete system is available at},

Abstract Optical flow estimation is one of the oldest and still most active research domains in computer vision. In 35 years, many methodological concepts have been introduced and have progressively improved performances, while opening the way to new challenges. In the last decade, the growing interest in evaluation benchmarks has stimulated a great amount of work. In this paper, we propose a survey of optical flow estimation classifying the main principles elaborated during this evolution, with a particular concern given to recent developments. It is conceived as a tutorial organizing in a comprehensive framework current approaches and practices. We give insights on the motivations, interests and limitations of modeling and optimization techniques, and we highlight similarities between methods to allow for a clear understanding of their behavior.},

Towards this goal, we derive a slanted-plane MRF model which explicitly reasons about the ordering of planes and their physical validity at junctions. Furthermore, we present a bottom-up grouping algorithm which produces over-segmentations that respect flow boundaries. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in the challenging KITTI flow benchmark [11] achieving half the error of the best competing general flow algorithm and one third of the error of the best epipolar flow algorithm.},

Recently, there have been major advances for doing object detection in a single image. These methods typically contain three phases: (i) object proposal generation (ii) object classification and (iii) post-processing. We propose a modification of the post-processing phase that uses high-scoring object detections from nearby frames to boost scores of weaker detections within the same clip. We show that our method obtains superior results to state-of-the-art single image object detection techniques. Our method placed 3rd in the video object detection (VID) task of the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge 2015 (ILSVRC2015).},

abstract = {For object recognition, the current state-of-the-art is based on exhaustive search. However, to enable the use of more expensive features and classifiers and thereby progress beyond the state-of-the-art, a selective search strategy is needed. Therefore, we adapt segmentation as a selective search by reconsidering segmentation: We propose to generate many approximate locations over few and precise object delineations because (1) an object whose location is never generated can not be recognised and (2) appearance and immediate nearby context are most effective for object recognition. Our method is class-independent and is shown to cover 96.7{\%} of all objects in the Pascal VOC 2007 test set using only 1,536 locations per image. Our selective search enables the use of the more expensive bag-of-words method which we use to substantially improve the state-of-the-art by up to 8.5{\%} for 8 out of 20 classes on the Pascal VOC 2010 detection challenge.},

We therefore present Scene-SIRFS, a generalization of SIRFS in which we have a mixture of shapes and a mixture of illuminations, and those mixture components are embedded in a " soft " segmentation of the input image. We additionally use the noisy depth maps provided by RGB-D sensors (in this case, the Kinect) to improve shape estimation. Our model takes as input a single RGB-D image and produces as output an improved depth map, a set of surface normals, a reflectance image, a shading image, and a spatially varying model of il-lumination.

abstract = {Figure 1: Real-time reconstructions of a moving scene with DynamicFusion; both the person and the camera are moving. The initially noisy and incomplete model is progressively denoised and completed over time (left to right). Abstract We present the first dense SLAM system capable of re-constructing non-rigidly deforming scenes in real-time, by fusing together RGBD scans captured from commodity sen-sors. Our DynamicFusion approach reconstructs scene ge-ometry whilst simultaneously estimating a dense volumet-ric 6D motion field that warps the estimated geometry into a live frame. Like KinectFusion, our system produces in-creasingly denoised, detailed, and complete reconstructions as more measurements are fused, and displays the updated model in real time. Because we do not require a template or other prior scene model, the approach is applicable to a wide range of moving objects and scenes. 3D scanning traditionally involves separate capture and off-line processing phases, requiring very careful planning of the capture to make sure that every surface is cov-ered. In practice, it's very difficult to avoid holes, requir-ing several iterations of capture, reconstruction, identifying holes, and recapturing missing regions to ensure a complete model. Real-time 3D reconstruction systems like KinectFu-sion [18, 10] represent a major advance, by providing users the ability to instantly see the reconstruction and identify regions that remain to be scanned. KinectFusion spurred a flurry of follow up research aimed at robustifying the track-ing [9, 32] and expanding its spatial mapping capabilities to larger environments [22, 19, 34, 31, 9]. However, as with all traditional SLAM and dense re-construction systems, the most basic assumption behind KinectFusion is that the observed scene is largely static. The core question we tackle in this paper is: How can we generalise KinectFusion to reconstruct and track dynamic,},

abstract = {We present a robust and real-time monocular six degree of freedom relocalization system. Our system trains a convolutional neural network to regress the 6-DOF camera pose from a single RGB image in an end-to-end manner with no need of additional engineering or graph optimisation. The algorithm can operate indoors and outdoors in real time, taking 5ms per frame to compute. It obtains approximately 2m and 3 degree accuracy for large scale outdoor scenes and 0.5m and 5 degree accuracy indoors. This is achieved using an efficient 23 layer deep convnet, demonstrating that convnets can be used to solve complicated out of image plane regression problems. This was made possible by leveraging transfer learning from large scale classification data. We show the convnet localizes from high level features and is robust to difficult lighting, motion blur and different camera intrinsics where point based SIFT registration fails. Furthermore we show how the pose feature that is produced generalizes to other scenes allowing us to regress pose with only a few dozen training examples.},

Taking advantage of the fact that outdoor scenes often decompose into a small number of independently mov- ing objects, we represent each element in the scene by its rigid motion parameters and each superpixel by a 3D plane as well as an index to the corresponding object. This minimal representation increases robustness and leads to a discrete-continuous CRF where the data term decomposes into pairwise potentials between superpixels and objects. Moreover, our model intrinsically segments the scene into its constituting dynamic components. We demonstrate the performance of our model on existing benchmarks as well as a novel realistic dataset with scene flow ground truth. We obtain this dataset by annotating 400 dynamic scenes from the KITTI raw data collection using detailed 3D CAD models for all vehicles in motion. Our experiments also re- veal novel challenges which cannot be handled by existing methods. 1.},

abstract = {PointNet has revolutionized how we think about representing point clouds. For classification and segmentation tasks, the approach and its subsequent extensions are state-of-the-art. To date, the successful application of PointNet to point cloud registration has remained elusive. In this paper we argue that PointNet itself can be thought of as a learnable "imaging" function. As a consequence, classical vision algorithms for image alignment can be applied on the problem - namely the Lucas {\&} Kanade (LK) algorithm. Our central innovations stem from: (i) how to modify the LK algorithm to accommodate the PointNet imaging function, and (ii) unrolling PointNet and the LK algorithm into a single trainable recurrent deep neural network. We describe the architecture, and compare its performance against state-of-the-art in common registration scenarios. The architecture offers some remarkable properties including: generalization across shape categories and computational efficiency - opening up new paths of exploration for the application of deep learning to point cloud registration.

abstract = {Semantic segmentation of outdoor scenes is problematic when there are variations in imaging conditions. It is known that albedo (reflectance) is invariant to all kinds of illumination effects. Thus, using reflectance images for semantic segmentation task can be favorable. Additionally, not only segmentation may benefit from reflectance, but also segmentation may be useful for reflectance computation. Therefore, in this paper, the tasks of semantic segmentation and intrinsic image decomposition are considered as a combined process by exploring their mutual relationship in a joint fashion. To that end, we propose a supervised end-to-end CNN architecture to jointly learn intrinsic image decomposition and semantic segmentation. We analyze the gains of addressing those two problems jointly. Moreover, new cascade CNN architectures for intrinsic-for-segmentation and segmentation-for-intrinsic are proposed as single tasks. Furthermore, a dataset of 35K synthetic images of natural environments is created with corresponding albedo and shading (intrinsics), as well as semantic labels (segmentation) assigned to each object/scene. The experiments show that joint learning of intrinsic image decomposition and semantic segmentation is beneficial for both tasks for natural scenes.

We propose a new geocentric embedding for depth images that encodes height above ground and angle with gravity for each pixel in addition to the horizontal disparity. We demonstrate that this geocentric embedding works better than using raw depth images for learning feature representations with convolutional neural networks. Our final object detection system achieves an average precision of 37.3{\%}, which is a 56{\%} relative improvement over existing methods. We then focus on the task of instance segmentation where we label pixels belonging to object instances found by our detector. For this task, we propose a decision forest approach that classifies pixels in the detection window as foreground or background using a family of unary and binary tests that query shape and geocentric pose features. Finally, we use the output from our object detectors in an existing superpixel classification framework for semantic scene segmentation and achieve a 24{\%} relative improvement over current state-of-the-art for the object categories that we study. We believe advances such as those represented in this paper will facilitate the use of perception in fields like robotics.},

abstract = {We present a method for detecting objects in images using a single deep neural network. Our approach, named SSD, discretizes the output space of bounding boxes into a set of default boxes over different aspect ratios and scales per feature map location. At prediction time, the network generates scores for the presence of each object category in each default box and produces adjustments to the box to better match the object shape. Additionally, the network combines pre-dictions from multiple feature maps with different resolutions to naturally handle objects of various sizes. SSD is simple relative to methods that require object proposals because it completely eliminates proposal generation and subsequent pixel or feature resampling stages and encapsulates all computation in a single network. This makes SSD easy to train and straightforward to integrate into sys-tems that require a detection component. Experimental results on the PASCAL VOC, COCO, and ILSVRC datasets confirm that SSD has competitive accuracy to methods that utilize an additional object proposal step and is much faster, while providing a unified framework for both training and inference. For 300 × 300 in-put, SSD achieves 74.3{\%} mAP 1 on VOC2007 test at 59 FPS on a Nvidia Titan X and for 512 × 512 input, SSD achieves 76.9{\%} mAP, outperforming a compa-rable state-of-the-art Faster R-CNN model. Compared to other single stage meth-ods, SSD has much better accuracy even with a smaller input image size. Code is available at: https://github.com/weiliu89/caffe/tree/ssd .},

abstract = {Part of the workshop is a challenge on combining 3D and semantic information in complex scenes. To this end, a challenging outdoor dataset, captured by a robot driving through a semantically-rich garden that contains fine geo-metric details, was released. A multi-camera rig is mounted on top of the robot, enabling the use of both stereo and mo-tion stereo information. Precise ground truth for the 3D structure of the garden has been obtained with a laser scan-ner and accurate pose estimates for the robot are available as well. Ground truth semantic labels and ground truth depth from a laser scan are used for benchmarking the qual-ity of the 3D reconstructions.},

In this work, we propose Point Completion Network (PCN), a novel learning-based approach for shape completion. Unlike existing shape completion methods, PCN directly operates on raw point clouds without any structural assumption (e.g. symmetry) or annotation (e.g. semantic class) about the underlying shape. It features a decoder design that enables the generation of fine-grained completions while maintaining a small number of parameters. Our experiments show that PCN produces dense, complete point clouds with realistic structures in the missing regions on inputs with various levels of incompleteness and noise, including cars from LiDAR scans in the KITTI dataset.},

In this paper, we propose to use depth maps for object detection and de-sign a 3D detector to overcome the major difficulties for recognition, namely the variations of texture, illumination, shape, viewpoint, clutter, occlusion, self-occlusion and sensor noises. We take a collection of 3D CAD models and render each CAD model from hundreds of viewpoints to obtain synthetic depth maps. For each depth rendering, we extract features from the 3D point cloud and train an Exemplar-SVM classifier. During testing and hard-negative mining, we slide a 3D detection window in 3D space. Experiment results show that our 3D detector significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms for both RGB and RGB-D images, and achieves about ×1.7 improvement on average precision compared to DPM and R-CNN.

In this work we introduce a new learnable module, the Spatial Transformer, which explicitly allows the spatial manipulation of data within the network. This differentiable module can be inserted into existing convolutional architectures, giving neural networks the ability to actively spatially transform feature maps, conditional on the feature map itself, without any extra training supervision or modification to the optimisation process. We show that the use of spatial transformers results in models which learn invariance to translation, scale, rotation and more generic warping, resulting in stateoftheart performance on several benchmarks, and for a number of classes of transformations.},

@article{Warren2009,
abstract = {We have recently suggested that the brain uses its sensitivity to optic flow in order to parse retinal motion into components arising due to self and object movement (e.g. Rushton, S. K., {\&} Warren, P. A. (2005). Moving observers, 3D relative motion and the detection of object movement. Current Biology, 15, R542-R543). Here, we explore whether stereo disparity is necessary for flow parsing or whether other sources of depth information, which could theoretically constrain flow-field interpretation, are sufficient. Stationary observers viewed large field of view stimuli containing textured cubes, moving in a manner that was consistent with a complex observer movement through a stationary scene. Observers made speeded responses to report the perceived direction of movement of a probe object presented at different depths in the scene. Across conditions we varied the presence or absence of different binocular and monocular cues to depth order. In line with previous studies, results consistent with flow parsing (in terms of both perceived direction and response time) were found in the condition in which motion parallax and stereoscopic disparity were present. Observers were poorer at judging object movement when depth order was specified by parallax alone. However, as more monocular depth cues were added to the stimulus the results approached those found when the scene contained stereoscopic cues. We conclude that both monocular and binocular static depth information contribute to flow parsing. These findings are discussed in the context of potential architectures for a model of the flow parsing mechanism. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We cast this into an image-to-image transformation task, and propose Iterative Generative Adversarial Networks (IterGANs) which iteratively transform an input image into an output image. Our models learn a visual representation that can be used for objects seen in training, but also for never seen objects. Since object manipulation requires a full understanding of the geometry and appearance of the object, our IterGANs learn an implicit 3D model and a full appearance model of the object, which are both inferred from a single (test) image. Two advantages of IterGANs are that the intermediate generated images can be used for an additional supervision signal, even in an unsupervised fashion, and that the number of iterations can be used as a control signal to steer the transformation. Experiments on rotated objects and scenes show how IterGANs help with the generation process.},

@article{Barth2020,
abstract = {In this paper we report on improving part segmentation performance for robotic vision using convolutional neural networks by optimising the visual realism of synthetic agricultural images. In Part I, a cycle consistent generative adversarial network was applied to synthetic and empirical images with the objective to generate more realistic synthetic images by translating them to the empirical domain. We hypothesise that plant part image features (e.g. color, texture) become more similar to the empirical domain after translation of the synthetic images. Results confirm this with an improved mean color distribution correlation with the empirical data prior of 0.62 and post translation of 0.90. Furthermore, the mean image features of contrast, homogeneity, energy and entropy moved closer to the empirical mean, post translation. In Part II, 7 experiments were performed using convolutional neural networks with different combinations of synthetic, synthetic translated to empirical and empirical images. We hypothesise that the translated images can be used for (i) improved learning of empirical images, and (ii) that learning without any fine-tuning with empirical images is improved by bootstrapping with translated images over bootstrapping with synthetic images. Results confirm our hypotheses in Part II. First a maximum intersection-over-union performance was achieved of 0.52 when bootstrapping with translated images and fine-tuning with empirical images; an 8{\%} increase compared to only using synthetic images. Second, training without any empirical fine-tuning resulted in an average IOU of 0.31; a 55{\%} performance increase over previous methods that only used synthetic images. The key contribution of this paper to robotic vision is to provide supporting evidence that domain adaptation can be successfully used to translate and improve synthetic data to the real empirical domain that results in improved segmentation learning whilst lowering the dependency on manually annotated data.},

abstract = {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it no-toriously hard to train models with saturating nonlineari-ties. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer in-puts. Our method draws its strength from making normal-ization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Nor-malization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization. It also acts as a regu-larizer, in some cases eliminating the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.9{\%} top-5 validation error (and 4.8{\%} test error), exceeding the ac-curacy of human raters.},

This apparent motion field is referred to as optical flow field, a two-dimensional vector field on the image plane. Because it is nearly impossible to cover the vast amount of approaches in the literature, in this chapter we set the focus on energy minimization approaches which estimate a dense flow field. The term dense refers to the fact that a flow vector is assigned to every (non-occluded) image pixel. Most dense approaches are based on the variational formulation of the optical flow problem, firstly suggested by Horn and Schunk. Depending on the application, density might be one important property besides accuracy and robustness. In many cases computational speed and real-time capability is a crucial issue. In this chapter we therefore discuss the latest progress in accuracy, robustness and real-time capability of dense optical flow algorithms.},

abstract = {Scene labeling research has mostly focused on outdoor scenes, leaving the harder case of indoor scenes poorly understood. Microsoft Kinect dramatically changed the landscape, showing great potentials for RGB-D perception (color+depth). Our main objective is to empirically understand the promises and challenges of scene labeling with RGB-D. We use the NYU Depth Dataset as collected and analyzed by Silberman and Fergus [30]. For RGB-D features, we adapt the framework of kernel descriptors that converts local similarities (kernels) to patch descriptors. For contextual modeling, we combine two lines of approaches, one using a superpixel MRF, and the other using a segmentation tree. We find that (1) kernel descriptors are very effective in capturing appearance (RGB) and shape (D) similarities; (2) both superpixel MRF and segmentation tree are useful in modeling context; and (3) the key to labeling accuracy is the ability to efficiently train and test with large-scale data. We improve labeling accuracy on the NYU Dataset from 56.6{\%} to 76.1{\%}. We also apply our approach to image-only scene labeling and improve the accuracy on the Stanford Background Dataset from 79.4{\%} to 82.9{\%}.},

abstract = {We present a novel deep learning framework for probabilistic pixel-wise semantic segmentation, which we term Bayesian SegNet. Pixel-wise semantic segmentation is an important step for visual scene understanding. It is a complex task requiring knowledge of support relationships and contextual information, as well as visual appearance. Our contribution is a practical system which is able to predict pixel-wise class labels with a measure of model uncertainty. We achieve this by Monte Carlo sampling with dropout at test time to generate a posterior distribution of pixel class labels. We show this Bayesian neural network provides a significant performance improvement in segmentation, with no additional parameterisation. We set a new benchmark with state-of-the-art performance on both the indoor SUN Scene Understanding and outdoor CamVid driving scenes datasets. Bayesian SegNet also performs competitively on Pascal VOC 2012 object segmentation challenge. For our web demo and source code, see http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/projects/segnet/},

abstract = {3D point cloud is an efficient and flexible representation of 3D structures. Recently, neural networks operating on point clouds have shown superior performance on 3D understanding tasks such as shape classification and part segmentation. However, performance on such tasks is evaluated on complete shapes aligned in a canonical frame, while real world 3D data are partial and unaligned. A key challenge in learning from partial, unaligned point cloud data is to learn features that are invariant or equivariant with respect to geometric transformations. To address this challenge, we propose the Iterative Transformer Network (IT-Net), a network module that canonicalizes the pose of a partial object with a series of 3D rigid transformations predicted in an iterative fashion. We demonstrate the efficacy of IT-Net as an anytime pose estimator from partial point clouds without using complete object models. Further, we show that IT-Net achieves superior performance over alternative 3D transformer networks on various tasks, such as partial shape classification and object part segmentation.},

The proposed SegFlow has two branches where useful information of object segmentation and optical flow is propagated bidirectionally in a unified framework. The segmentation branch is based on a fully convolutional network, which has been proved effective in image segmentation task, and the optical flow branch takes advantage of the FlowNet model. The unified framework is trained iteratively offline to learn a generic notion, and fine-tuned online for specific objects. Extensive experiments on both the video object segmentation and optical flow datasets demonstrate that introducing optical flow improves the performance of segmentation and vice versa, against the state-of-the-art algorithms.},

@article{Snoek2012,
abstract = {Machine learning algorithms frequently require careful tuning of model hyperparameters, regularization terms, and optimization parameters. Unfortunately, this tuning is often a "black art" that requires expert experience, unwritten rules of thumb, or sometimes brute-force search. Much more appealing is the idea of developing automatic approaches which can optimize the performance of a given learning algorithm to the task at hand. In this work, we consider the automatic tuning problem within the framework of Bayesian optimization, in which a learning algorithm's generalization performance is modeled as a sample from a Gaussian process (GP). The tractable posterior distribution induced by the GP leads to efficient use of the information gathered by previous experiments, enabling optimal choices about what parameters to try next. Here we show how the effects of the Gaussian process prior and the associated inference procedure can have a large impact on the success or failure of Bayesian optimization. We show that thoughtful choices can lead to results that exceed expert-level performance in tuning machine learning algorithms. We also describe new algorithms that take into account the variable cost (duration) of learning experiments and that can leverage the presence of multiple cores for parallel experimentation. We show that these proposed algorithms improve on previous automatic procedures and can reach or surpass human expert-level optimization on a diverse set of contemporary algorithms including latent Dirichlet allocation, structured SVMs and convolutional neural networks.},

Recent attempts with supervised learning have shown promise in this direction but also highlighted the need for enormous quantity of supervised data --- performance increases in proportion to the amount of data used. However, this quickly becomes prohibitive when considering the manual labour needed to collect such data. In this work, we focus our attention on depth based semantic per-pixel labelling as a scene understanding problem and show the potential of computer graphics to generate virtually unlimited labelled data from synthetic 3D scenes. By carefully synthesizing training data with appropriate noise models we show comparable performance to state-of-the-art RGBD systems on NYUv2 dataset despite using only depth data as input and set a benchmark on depth-based segmentation on SUN RGB-D dataset. Additionally, we offer a route to generating synthesized frame or video data, and understanding of different factors influencing performance gains.},

With the recent availability of inexpensive 2.5D depth sensors (e.g. Microsoft Kinect), it is becoming increasingly important to have a powerful 3D shape representation in the loop. Apart from category recognition, recovering full 3D shapes from viewbased 2.5D depth maps is also a critical part of visual understanding. To this end, we propose to represent a geometric 3D shape as a probability distribution of binary variables on a 3D voxel grid, using a Convolutional Deep Belief Network. Our model, 3D ShapeNets, learns the distribution of complex 3D shapes across different object categories and arbitrary poses from raw CAD data, and discovers hierarchical compositional part representations automatically. It naturally supports joint object recognition and shape completion from 2.5D depth maps, and it enables active object recognition through view planning. To train our 3D deep learning model, we construct ModelNet – a large-scale 3D CAD model dataset. Extensive experiments show that our 3D deep representation enables significant performance improvement over the-state-of-the-arts in a variety of tasks.},

This work brings together methods from DCNNs and probabilistic graphical models for addressing the task of pixel-level classification (also called " semantic image segmentation "). We show that responses at the final layer of DCNNs are not sufficiently localized for accurate object segmentation. This is due to the very invariance properties that make DCNNs good for high level tasks. We overcome this poor localization property of deep networks by combining the responses at the final DCNN layer with a fully connected Conditional Random Field (CRF). Qualitatively, our " DeepLab " system is able to localize segment boundaries at a level of accuracy which is beyond previous methods. Quantita-tively, our method sets the new state-of-art at the PASCAL VOC-2012 semantic image segmentation task, reaching 71.6{\%} IOU accuracy in the test set. We show how these results can be obtained efficiently: Careful network re-purposing and a novel application of the 'hole' algorithm from the wavelet community allow dense computation of neural net responses at 8 frames per second on a modern GPU.},

One way to extract multi-scale features is by feeding several resized input images to a shared deep network and then merge the resulting multi-scale features for pixel-wise classification. In this work, we adapt a state-of-art semantic image segmentation model with multi-scale input images. We jointly train the network and an attention model which learns to softly weight the multi-scale features, and show that it outperforms average- or max-pooling over scales. The proposed attention model allows us to diagnostically visualize the importance of features at different positions and scales. Moreover, we show that adding extra supervision to the output of DCNN for each scale is essential to achieve excellent performance when merging multi-scale features. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model with exhaustive experiments on three challenging datasets, including PASCAL-Person-Part, PASCAL VOC 2012 and a subset of MS-COCO 2014.},
